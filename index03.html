      <p>Recommendation Algorithm.</p>

      <p>Recommendation algorithm is a machine learning process that intentionally tries to predict users’ preferences based on users’ previous selection. The social media listed above all utilizes recommendation algorithm to give users “more personalized experience.” </p>
    </div>

    <div class="line4" data-aos="fade-right">
      <p>Tech moguls utilize such a programming technique was more than simply providing personalized experience — they wanted to keep people on their apps as long as possible so that they could gain more benefits from their sponsors. Based on such a fact, the following situation is happening around the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="line5" data-aos="fade-left">
      <p>One problematic situation is the conflict between groups that hold different opinions intensifies. It is very common now to see how easy it can be for two people who held different opinions would argue with one another. Such an occurrence is derived from recommendation algorithm. This is because when the recommendation algorithm only recommends what the user likes, the users’ vision of horizon is limited to their own worlds. Therefore, they are not able to view many other opinions and solidifies their own perspectives to a greater degree.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="line6" data-aos="fade-right">
      <p>Another problematic situation is that the loss privacy because the algorithm constantly watches on you. All your activities on this app would be monitored. Moreover, when communicating with another person on the internet, the ego intensifies as well because we are constantly aware that we are not simply exchanging information individually in real life. Instead, we are actually communicating in front of millions of audiences. Therefore, sometimes the exchange of information is not important any more. It is the winning sense matters. Such an illusion of winning actually deviates us from the reality. </p>
